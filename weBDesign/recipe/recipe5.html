             As I have used cooked sausages once the batter is cooked, <br></br>
             you can remove from the pan. I place on some kitchen towel <br></br>
             to remove some of the oil and once the sticks are cooled you can eat. <br></br>
             If you want a nice dipping sauce, mix together 3 tablespoons of tomato ketchup, <br></br>
             1 tablespoon of gochujang and sugar.<br></br>
             If you want to make more of a meal of it you can cook <br></br>
             some chicken breast in the same way and serve with some fries.<br></br>
